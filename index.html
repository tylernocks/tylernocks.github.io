								<h2>What are the educational oppertunities?<br />
								Why are educational opportunities important</h2>
								<p>In Chicago’s Humboldt Park neighborhood, there are a total of eighteen schools with five of them being charter schools. The number is comprised of six high schools, which have an average ACT score of fourteen, and twelve elementary schools (Chicago Public Schools).<br />
								<br />
								With no foundation for developing teens and children, the community of Humboldt Park would become unstable. Uneducated teens with unrefined skills would no longer be able to support fellow community members by creating services to sustain the neighborhood. With an abundance of educational opportunities given to the Humboldt Park neighborhood, the economical status would flourish and allow for families and individuals to build off of each others’ progress. Ultimately, a true community would be established when every individual has the privilege to refine skills to create service that would benefit everyone in their local neighborhood.</p>

								<h2>What is the current state of educational opportunities in Humboldt Park? <br /></h2>
								<p>
									A large portion of CPS schools have been closed. This is due to a lack of money and funding that CPS schools are often faced with. CBS Chicago wrote an article discussing some of the 53 public schools have been closed. One of the schools discussed, Lafayette Elementary, has almost 500 students, with a little less than 200 of their students being autistic. “At Jean D. Lafayette Elementary School, the principal informed teachers and staff Thursday morning that the Humboldt Park neighborhood school is on the school closing list. The school has approximately 470 students, over 170 of them with autism” (CPS to Close A Total Of 53 Schools). Not only does this school lack sufficient funding to keep the school going, but because it is in a low-income neighborhood such as Humboldt Park, the likeliness of it closing is much greater than it would be for a school in a higher income area such as Lincoln Park or Wicker Park.

								<h2>What are decision makers saying? <br /></h2>
								<p>One of the most difficult positions in the educational community is having to be the people who decide what happens within the schools; over these 2 years, schools in the Humboldt Park community have been put in perilous situations. Lafayette, Ryerson, Von Humboldt, Piccolo, and Duprey were all schools that could have been closed in the year of 2013. Having this many schools on a closing list in one area not only affects the reputation of the community but it also affects the students who attend the schools. The students learning experience is not something that decision makers should be playing with. The President of the Chicago Teachers Union Karen Lewis said “Look at the murder rate in this city. He’s murdering schools, he’s murdering good jobs. He’s murdering housing. I don’t know what else to call him. He’s the murder mayor.” disapproving of the actions the mayor has taken towards schools in Chicago. Many low-income families send their children to these schools, and closing the schools that serve a large portion of low-income families will only worsen the situations the families are going through.  Low-income families need these schools because they have no other access to a better education therefore making it an important situation for decision makers to handle immediately. <br />
								<br />
								However, there are some decision makers, like CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who want to improve the education in the Humboldt Park are. Byrd-Bennett said, in response to CPS school closings, that “ like school systems in New York and Philadelphia, where enrollment has dropped, Chicago must make tough choices. Consolidating schools is the best way to make sure all of our city’s students get the resources they need to learn and succeed”. Although this is just one person’s thoughts, it takes one person to cause a change in a community. Humboldt Park needs the improvement of education so that students can improve their community and bring new opportunities like the development of new schools in the Humboldt Park area.
