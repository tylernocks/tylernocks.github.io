								<h2>What are the educational opportunities?<br />
								Why are educational opportunities important?</h2>
								<p>In Chicago’s Humboldt Park neighborhood, there are a total of eighteen schools with five of them being charter schools. The number is comprised of six high schools, which have an average ACT score of fourteen, and twelve elementary schools (Chicago Public Schools).<br />
								<br />
								With no foundation for developing teens and children, the community of Humboldt Park would become unstable. Uneducated teens with unrefined skills would no longer be able to support fellow community members by creating services to sustain the neighborhood. With an abundance of educational opportunities given to the Humboldt Park neighborhood, the economical status would flourish and allow for families and individuals to build off of each others’ progress. Ultimately, a true community would be established when every individual has the privilege to refine skills to create service that would benefit everyone in their local neighborhood.</p>

								<h2>What is the current state of educational opportunities in Humboldt Park? <br /></h2>
								<p>
									A large portion of CPS schools have been closed. This is due to a lack of money and funding that CPS schools are often faced with. CBS Chicago wrote an article discussing some of the 53 public schools have been closed. One of the schools discussed, Lafayette Elementary, has almost 500 students, with a little less than 200 of their students being autistic. In a report about schools closing in Humboldt Park, it is stated that “At Jean D. Lafayette Elementary School, the principal informed teachers and staff Thursday morning that the Humboldt Park neighborhood school is on the school closing list. The school has approximately 470 students, over 170 of them with autism” (CPS to Close A Total Of 53 Schools). Not only do these schools lack sufficient funding to keep the school going, but because it is in a low-income neighborhood such as Humboldt Park, the likeliness of it closing is much greater than it would be for a school in a higher income area such as Lincoln Park or Wicker Park. Having such a large number of schools close will cause the level of education that people are receiving to decrease, thus causing the amount of people that are positively supporting the community to decrease because no one will come back to aid a community they were raised in if they aren’t equipped with the proper educational opportunities.

								<h2>What are decision makers saying? <br /></h2>
								<p>One of the most difficult positions in the educational community is having to be the people who decide what happens within the schools; over these 2 years, schools in the Humboldt Park community have been put in perilous situations. Lafayette, Ryerson, Von Humboldt, Piccolo, and Duprey were all schools that could have been closed in the year of 2013. Having this many schools on a closing list in one area not only affects the reputation of the community but it also affects the students who attend the schools. The students learning experience is not something that decision makers should be playing with. The President of the Chicago Teachers Union Karen Lewis said “Look at the murder rate in this city. He’s murdering schools, he’s murdering good jobs. He’s murdering housing. I don’t know what else to call him. He’s the murder mayor.” disapproving of the actions the mayor has taken towards schools in Chicago. Many low-income families send their children to these schools, and closing the schools that serve a large portion of low-income families will only worsen the situations the families are going through.  Low-income families need these schools because they have no other access to a better education therefore making it an important situation for decision makers to handle immediately. <br />
								<br />
								However, there are some decision makers, like CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who want to improve the education in the Humboldt Park are. Byrd-Bennett said, in response to CPS school closings, that “ like school systems in New York and Philadelphia, where enrollment has dropped, Chicago must make tough choices. Consolidating schools is the best way to make sure all of our city’s students get the resources they need to learn and succeed”. Although this is just one person’s thoughts, it takes one person to cause a change in a community. Humboldt Park needs the improvement of education so that students can improve their community and bring new opportunities like the development of new schools in the Humboldt Park area.

								<h2>What are community members saying? <br /></h2>
								<p> There are many members of the Humboldt community that are saying pretty much the exact same thing: they feel as though the schools in their area are no good, but they haven’t any other choices due to issues with things such as money. One member of the community said “Amundsen school has got to be the worst school in Chicago. Teachers are lacking on motivation, Munos only cares about the 'allusion' of a good school. But I have to send my child here because it is the closest. I'm a single parent and can’t afford anything else” (“Amundsen High School”). This shows that people know that the schools they are sending their children in their community are not good schools, but they ultimately have no other choice because they are being restricted by other issues that need more attention in their eyes. Parents have to resort to sending their children to schools that may not be the best ones out there because things such as money and distance come into play. Around the Humboldt Park area, there aren’t many good schools around because the neighborhood is not very wealthy and the neighborhood itself is not one of the more safer ones in the city of Chicago. This relates to health in multiple ways. For example, when kids are sent to their neighborhood elementary schools due to lack of money or an issue with distance, they will most likely end up going to their neighborhood high schools which can cause the students to receive education that may not be as effective as that of a high school that is not a neighborhood school. This is an issue because for example, if the students at the neighborhood school were not given proper sexual education, the chance of them getting pregnant or impregnating someone or even obtaining STDs or STIs is much greater than that of someone attending a school with better sexual education courses. If a student is not given proper sexual education, then if they impregnate someone or become pregnant, they will most likely stop their education so that they are able to provide for the baby that is on the way, thus making it more difficult to get a job because the majority of jobs now a days require at least a GED, and they may not have this so they will have to resort to anything they can take to be able to provide for the child that they have just had. <br />

								<h2>What is the media saying? <br /></h2>
								<P>Media reports and opinions on the educational opportunities in Humboldt park are negative, with complaints about the violence going on within the schools themselves to the recent closing of 5 of humboldt parks schools. Many parents have protested against the closing of several schools in the area. At a protest not too long ago, a women named Burgos tweeted “Police officers trying to get us to leave, but we are not leaving!!!!” early on in the protest. With the closing of 4 schools in east Humboldt park, the area is left without any public schools. Many parents and teachers have also tweeted things such as “our children need to value education more and stop all the nonsense fighting” and “ I should be able to feel safe sending my children off to school and expect them to come back without cuts and bruises or stolen items.”  <br /> </p>

								<h2>What can be done to improve educational opportunities</h2>
								<p>In order to improve the education in Humboldt Park, people in the community must take action. They must spend more time instilling a love for learning, and having multiple opportunities for after school activities such as sports, which keeps students in the safety of the school, rather than the streets. The extremely high crime and poverty rate that is negatively affecting the people of Humboldt Park both mentally and physically can be attributed primarily from the lack of adequate education. Improving the overall learning environment for students will undoubtedly improve the education system in the Humboldt Park neighborhood by introducing changes to the rudimentary curricular and teaching management. Small, steady steps are taken to reestablish a foundation where all community members feel secure sending their child to attend school daily.
